======================================================================

✓ Sequential SNN model defined
   This model can maintain neuron state across predictions
   Useful for learning temporal patterns in branch execution
======================================================================
            SEQUENTIAL vs INDEPENDENT PROCESSING
======================================================================

🔄 Current Approach (Independent):
   • Each branch prediction resets neuron state
   • No memory of previous branches
   • Branch history in input is the only temporal info
   • Treats branches as i.i.d. samples

🧠 Sequential Approach (with SNN Memory):
   • Neuron states carry over between predictions
   • Network 'remembers' recent branch patterns
   • Leverages SNN's inherent temporal dynamics
   • More realistic for actual CPU execution

💡 Why This Matters for Branch Prediction:
   • Branches follow execution flow patterns
   • Loop branches repeat regularly
   • Function call patterns are predictable
   • Context from recent branches improves accuracy

📊 Dataset Structure:
   Total samples: 350,783
   These are sequential branch decisions from CPU execution
   Order matters - shuffling destroys temporal patterns!

✓ Fixed: Now using sequential split (80/20)
✓ Fixed: Disabled shuffling in DataLoaders
✓ Next: Train sequential model to leverage SNN memory
